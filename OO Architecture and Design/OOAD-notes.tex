\chapter{Abstraction}
There are different meanning of abstractin. one of them is the ability to capture real world entities as classes.
Two types of abstractions in Java:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{interfaces}, used to define expected behaviour.Implementation \textbf{is hidden from a client}.
	\item \textbf{abstract classes}, used to define incomplete functionality.
\end{itemize}



\chapter{Inheritance}
The ability of subclass to derive members (fields and methods) from ascendands. In java only single parent class is allowed. It is an \textbf{'is-a'} relationship.
\textbf{Derived class inherits all members present in the base class. 
However not all of them are accessible}. This is ruled by access modifiers used in the base class.


\section{Accessing Members}
It is valid to instantiate an object with a subtype. The instantiated reference variable allows an access to those members (and their variations) which are present in their type.
It is still possible to access subtype members using cast:
\begin{verbatim}
Parent childParent = new Child();
\\ access to a member as it is defined in the Parent class.
childParent.field... 

\\ access to a member as it is defined in the Child class
((Child)childParent).field 
\end{verbatim}
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Pay attention to the syntax of above cast!}}
%
%\begin{tabular}{i|l|l|l}
%	types & fields & cast & method calls \\
%	\hline
%	Parent pc = new Child() & parent & \textbf{to child} & \textbf{child \textcolor{red}{(*)}}\\
%	Parent p = new Parent() & parent & \textcolor{red}{\textbf{error!} & parent} \\
%	Child c = new Child() & child & \textbf{to parent} & child \\
%	Child c = new Parent() & \textcolor{red}{\textbf{error!}} & &\\
%	\hline
%\end{tabular}\\

\par
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{*  Those method which are overridden are accessible as usual.\\
In order to call methods that are not overridden the reference variable 
used to access the methods (here - \textit{pc}) must be cast to (Child)}}


\section{Pitfalls}

\subsection{Constructor Calls an Overridable Method}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item call to constructor in \textbf{child class}
	\item it calls \textbf{parent class constructor} first
	\item if there is a call to overridable method it calls \textcolor{red}{\textbf{textchild version of the method}}
	\item \textbf{ERROR! }The call \textcolor{red}{\textbf{will fail}} if the method references some uninitialised variable.
	\textcolor{red}{\textbf{The variable can be initialised only when the control returns to child constructor - in steps which will folow!}}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Liskov Substitution Principle}
Whenever an instance of some class is expected in a program, 
one can suply an instance  of subclass of the class



\chapter{Encapsulation}
Inner details of classes can be hidden by making them private and acceptible
through public API only - getters (accessors) and setters (mutators).



\chapter{Polymorphism , Method Overriding}
\textit{'Many forms'}. implemented by
\begin{itemize}
	\item subclass specialisation (\textit{is-a'} relationship
	\item Liskov substitution principle
	\item virtual method invocation)
\end{itemize}
Polymorphism is usually achieved by method overriding. It utilises method dynamic binding.


\section{Virtual method Invocation}
Method calls are dynamically dispatched based on runtime type of the receiver object.


\section{Method Overloading}
Overloading means that two or more methods have the same name
 but different signature. They \textbf{must have different parameters} (number of them and/or types),
 they \textbf{may have different return type and access modifiers} (private, protected, etc) - see Rules.
 
 
\section{Method Overriding}
It means that new implementation is provided to an inherited method. This is annotated by @Override. The overridden method in a superclass can be still called 
when invoked using \textbf{super.} keyword.

\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{final, static, private} methods can't be overridden.
	\item access modifier of overriding method \textbf{must not be more restrictive}.
	\item \textbf{no new checked exception} can be thrown
	\item if return type is a reference type, then it can be original type or any descendant of this type (\textbf{covariant return type}).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Private} methods can't be overriden because they are excluded from inheritance (not visible from within subclasses). \\
\textbf{Static} methods reside in static context, they belong to class, not to objects. Therefore they are not inherited, too. Hence, they can't be overriden. \\
However, they can be \textbf{shadowed} - subclass can have static method with the same name, as its parent class. A method call is bind to first method with a proper signature - starting 
from the class in current context and going up the inheritance tree.
